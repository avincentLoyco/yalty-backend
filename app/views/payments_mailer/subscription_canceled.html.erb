<h3 style='color: #2ab27b'>We had a problem billing your account</h3>
<p>Hi,</p>>

<p>We regret to inform you that we tried several times to process your payment, but your credit card was declined again. We have deactivated the premium features from your account for the moment.
If you have a new credit card, please update your billing settings directly in the app, so we can re-activate your premium features.</p>
