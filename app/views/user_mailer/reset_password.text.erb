Hi there,

You recently requested to request your password for your yalty account.

Here is a link that allows you to create a new password:
<%= subdomain_url_for(@user.account) %>/password?reset_password_token=<%= @user.reset_password_token %>

If you remember your password, just ignore this email and your password will not change.

Thanks!

The Team at yalty
